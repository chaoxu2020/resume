# Portably to export Résumé using Markdown PDF

In this repo, I used [VSCode Extension Markdown PDF](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf) to conveniently export CV to PDF file, with Git to achieve version management of resume in different stages.

## Branches

### Main
Chinese version of resume. (Default)

### English_ver
English version of resume, with exporting parameters modified differently from Chinese version.

## Usage

Pull the repo and open in VSCode. \
Install [VSCode Extension Markdown PDF](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf).\
Open the folder and `template.md` in VSCode.\
Right-click in `template.md` and select `Markdown PDF export (pdf)`.\
This will generate `template.pdf`, which is the PDF format of CV.\
Modify or update as your need.
